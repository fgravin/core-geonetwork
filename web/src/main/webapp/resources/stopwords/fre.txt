             | 1st person sing
i              | subject, always in upper case of course

me             | object
my             | possessive adjective
               | the possessive pronoun `mine' is best suppressed, because of the
               | sense of coal-mine etc.
myself         | reflexive
             | 1st person plural
we             | subject

| us           | object
               | care is required here because US = United States. It is usually
               | safe to remove it if it is in lower case.
our            | possessive adjective
ours           | possessive pronoun

doing          | -ing form

 | The forms below are, I believe, best omitted, because of the significant
 | homonym forms:

 |  He made a WILL
 |  old tin CAN
 |  merry month of MAY

 | would, could, should, ought might however be included
